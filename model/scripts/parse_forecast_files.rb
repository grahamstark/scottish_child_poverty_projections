"These predictions are based on prevalence rates in a report by Eric Emerson and Chris Hatton of the Institute for Health Research, Lancaster University, entitled Estimating Future Need/Demand for Supports for Adults with Learning Disabilities in England, June 2004. The authors take the prevalence base rates and adjust these rates to take account of ethnicity (i.e. the increased prevalence of learning disabilities in South Asian communities) and of mortality (i.e. both increased survival rates of young people with severe and complex disabilities and reduced mortality among older adults with learning disabilities). Therefore, figures are based on an estimate of prevalence across the national population; locally this will produce an over-estimate in communities with a low South Asian community, and an under-estimate in communities with a high South Asian community."

These include: getting in and out of bed, getting in and out of a chair, dressing, washing, feeding, and use of the toilet.
