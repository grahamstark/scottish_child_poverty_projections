## ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

I've got some participation rates by age & sex to 2066 from the [OBR
Sustainability forecast][OBRSUSTAB]. 

From the [Economic and fiscal outlook tables][OBRFISTAB]  (1.6), I think participation is "LFS
participation rate, all aged 16 and over (ONS identifier: MGWG)"

and

LFS ~Inactivity~ is: [People not in employment who have not been seeking work
within the last 4 weeks and/or are unable to start work within the next 2
weeks.][ONSINACTIVE].

Activity is presumably the inverse of that.

Do you know how to map that on to the FRS? 

I can find `dvil04a`: [EcInAct - ILO economically inactive][ILOINACTIVE] "

> "A person is economically inactive, according to the International Labour
Organisation definition, if he or she is not part of the labour force. So
inactive people are neither employed nor unemployed. The inactive population can
include pre-school children, school children, students, pensioners and
housewives or -men, for example, provided that they are not working at all and
not available or looking for work either; some of these may be of working-age."
